# Sky-Voice
HERE IS HOW TO GET IT WORKING ON ALL OS's EXCEPT WINDOWS XP

Okay I've gone ahead and made a profile to make this mod go smoother. You only need the to download the esp from this mod and follow my instructions. Honestly you should all use this method. It's far superior to the default windows speech recognition  

Note: You will not be using Windows Speech Recognition or it's macros with this method.

Download and install voicemacro from their site: http://www.voicemacro.net/

Download my macro here: https://github.com/Searangerx/Sky-Voice/blob/master/Skyrim%20Shouts.xml

(Note: I've only made macros for the default Skyrim shouts. None of the Thunder Child shouts are in yet. I may do this later.)

Open VoiceMacro.

Click Edit a new window will pop up

Click the Import button

Import the Skyrim Macro profile you downloaded before.

Click save 

You should now be on the main Voicemacro screen. On the Right side are 3 bars. Click on them and open recognizer settings

Change Wordlist weight to 100%
Change Dictionary Weight to 0%
Click OK

You are ready to go. The app must remain running along side Skyrim to work.
